# Gilded Rose kata
The Gilded Rose kata in Kotlin

This is my first attempt at this kata. I'm not sure if I really followed the spirit of it. I wrote the tests I felt necessary after reading GildedRoseRequirements.txt, then I replaced most of the business logic in one fell swoop, before refactoring it into a better shape.

Next time I'll work through it in smaller steps.
